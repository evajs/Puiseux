# Puiseux
Wolfram Mathematica package Puiseux

I have not found any implementation of rational Puiseux series as a package to any common software (Maple, Mathematica, Matlab), so I have implemented it in Mathematica. The package computes (rational) Puiseux series of a given polynomial. As the auxiliary procedures, it can also compute and plot the Newton polygon of the polynomial and the field of coefficients of the Puiseux series.
